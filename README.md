# **This is a bot for Pokemon Showdown**
# Designed from the ground up by Jared Chudzinski
# For fun :)

## The bot is designed to be easy to pick up and use by all

### Required programs
### _Python3, selenium, geckodriver_
### Once all three are installed you will need to add geckodriver to your PATH
### _This step can be kind of a pain, on MacOS I ended up just copying the exec to usr/local/bin_
### From there everything you need to log into a tester bot is in this repo


## I will update this bot as I add more functionality
